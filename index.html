				<p>My name is Matthew and I have been trying to get several projects going that require some website design knowledge as well as some operating system and networking capabilities.</p>

					<li><h4>3DLinux</h4></li>
						<p>One of the first items that got me interested in pursuing website design and computer engineering was the movie Avengers:  Voltron.  I was really taken aback by the scene where it showed Voltron coming to life and the interactions it had with Jarvis.  Also, the way that it searching the internet and carried out its desire to become a cyborg.  That is why I have been studying Linux to see how I can incorporate those elements.</p>
					<li><h4>Biotropolis</h4></li>
						<p>Another idea I have is trying to promote the planting of and appreciation for trees that are growing in our neighborhoods.  A website that lists some of the oldest trees and possible means of preserving them would be my ultimate goal.  This would require some mapping knowledge.</p>
					<li><h4>Blender Bakery</h4></li>
						<p>I have always been a fan of animation.  I have learned some of the basics on Blender and think it is a great platform for collaborating with others to create movies or 3D images.  I would like to create a server that can host projects which has a platform to manage the projects from concept to completion.  Somewhat similar to github for software projects.</p>
					<li><h4>Collaborate With ME!</h4></li>
				<p>Follow the COLLABORATE WITH ME! link to be directed to the area where you can provide your information and I can reach out to you on any ideas we can discuss.  Thank you for your time.</p>
