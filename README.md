Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My website consists of the four below html webpages:

  index.html - a brief introduction of myself and the other webpages in the project
  3DLinux.html - a breakdown of my thoughts on this project and a start off point to develop further
  biotropolis.html - a simple starting point for incorporating this idea and using some of the lessons to move it forward
  BlenderBakery.html - a webpage listing some of the major components needed to move this project further
  collaboratewithme.html - a webpage with forms to complete in order to gather contact information and work on a project
  
Each webpage has a Directory that allows the visitor to go from one webpage to another.

The Directory was created using an unordered list, the index.html page has an order list for the different projects.

The BlenderBakery.html webpage has a table that lists the initial drawings for the idea with a header and two rows.  The second row includes several pictures and descriptions in the third row for each.

A stylesheet file was created for each webpage.  Each webpage has a different color scheme that I tried to match up with the subject.
  The stylesheets use the below CSS properties and elements:
