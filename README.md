# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My website consists of the four below html webpages:

  index.html - a brief introduction of myself and the other webpages in the project
  3DLinux.html - a breakdown of my thoughts on this project and a start off point to develop further
  biotropolis.html - a simple starting point for incorporating this idea and using some of the lessons to move it forward
  BlenderBakery.html - a webpage listing some of the major components needed to move this project further
  collaboratewithme.html - a webpage with forms to complete in order to gather contact information and work on a project
  
Each webpage has a Directory that allows the visitor to go from one webpage to another.

The Directory was created using an unordered list, the index.html page has an order list for the different projects.

The BlenderBakery.html webpage has a table that lists the initial drawings for the idea with a header and two rows.  The second row includes several pictures and descriptions in the third row for each.

A stylesheet file was created for each webpage.  Each webpage has a different color scheme that I tried to match up with the subject.
  The stylesheets use the below CSS properties and elements:
    CSS Properties:
      font-size
      font-family
      color
      font-weight
      display
      background-color
        
  There are also various CSS properties included in the style pages for some of the html pages
  
    CSS Elements:
      footer
      ul
      h2
      ol
      body

The .col-9 selector was also used on a div class and the #Directory selector was used on a div id.

The stylesheet for the biotropolis.html page includes a @media query and shrinks the paragraph down for smaller screens.

Bootstrap was included in the header for each webpage and a specific column layout using col-9, col-lg-8, and col-lg-4 was used for several divs in the webpages to give them a column layout using the grid model.  The boostrap element for both the forms on the collaboratewithme.html page was used along with a button element on the biotropolis.html page.

The stylesheets use the SCSS variables listed below:
  $color
  $body-color
  $back-color
  $body-font-color
  $ffamily
  
There is SCSS nesting in the stylesheet for the class .col-9 and h2, along with a in the id #Directory.

Include a description for inheritance here.  One option are the spans in the BlenderBakery.html page.
